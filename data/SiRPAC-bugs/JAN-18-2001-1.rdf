<!-- Test for a rdf:ID attribute in a propertyElt.  Version 1.0 of the M&S 
     spec says:

       [[
         Within propertyElt (production [6.12]), the URI used in a resource 
         attribute identifies (after resolution) the resource that is the object 
         of the statement (i.e., the value of this property). The value of the 
         ID attribute, if specified, is the identifier for the resource that 
         represents the reification of the statement.
       ]]

     Consequently, the property prop_1 should be reified withe "prop1_ID" as
     the subject.
